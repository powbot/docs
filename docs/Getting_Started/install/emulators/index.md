# Running PowBot on an Android Emulator

You can run PowBot on any Android emulator that supports the requirements listed in the [requirements](../install/index.md) page.

We highly recommend you to use Bluestacks 5 or LDPlayer on a Windows machine for the best stability and performance.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I run PowBot on a Mac?**

- A: Yes, you can run PowBot on a Mac. We do not currently have any guides for this but our users have reported success using Genymotion on ARM Macs, and AVD on Intel Macs. Please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/powbot) and ask in the #help channel if you need help with this.

**Q: Can I run PowBot on a Linux machine?**

- A: Yes, you can run PowBot on a Linux machine but we **highly** do not recommend it. The only emulator that is supported is genymotion alongside a few tweaks. Performance will be very poor in comparison to both Windows and Mac.
