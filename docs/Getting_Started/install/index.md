Although PowBot can be installed on both emulators and real devices, the steps are slightly different. The guides will cover the different options you will have.

* Please note that PowBot does not and will never support IOS. 


### Installer Requirements:

Please make sure you reboot your PC after installing.
* Able to use a device or run an android emulator which meets the requirements below.

### Device Requirements:
